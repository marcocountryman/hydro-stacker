                    <p>Hydro-Stacker Systemsâ„¢ is a hydroponic vertical gardening system. 
                        Using Hydro-Stackers Systems can increase your fruit and vegetable 
                        yield while decreasing the garden space needed. Grow just about any 
                        plant from your garden using just a few square feet. Our automated 
                        systems do all the watering for you, requiring less effort to get 
                        your garden growing. Hydro-Stacker is currently operating in large 
                        farms with more than 50,000 plants as well as home users with just 
                        a single-stack manual. You won't find a better way to hydroponically
                         grow strawberries, lettuce, tomatoes, cabbage, spinach, peas, basil,
                          dill, or any of the other hundreds of plants that love to grow in 
                          our Hydro-Stacker systems!</p>

                    <p>Our growing systems keep you involved in the plant life cycle by you 
                        determining the watering schedule. Our system includes an electric
                         pump and timer (you will need to get your own reservoir, 
                         a 55-gallon drum works great) for worry-free growing. 
                         Just fill the reservoir up as needed (about once every two weeks), 
                         and let the sun do all the work. Virtually any plant that can
                          be grown in soil can be grown in a Hydro-Stacker unit 
                          (obviously large plants like trees won't fare well). 
                          Pick up a couple of manual units for the corners of 
                          your driveway, flowers will grow so large they will look 
                          like shrubs</p>
