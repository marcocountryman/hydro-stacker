                <p>Hydro-Stacker Systemsâ„¢ is a hydroponic vertical gardening system. 
                    Using Hydro-Stackers Systems can increase your fruit and vegetable 
                    yield while decreasing the garden space needed. Grow just about any 
                    plant from your garden using just a few square feet. Our automated 
                    systems do all the watering for you, requiring less effort to get 
                    your garden growing. Hydro-Stacker is currently operating in large 
                    farms with more than 50,000 plants as well as home users with just 
                    a single-stack manual. You won't find a better way to hydroponically
                    grow strawberries, lettuce, tomatoes, cabbage, spinach, peas, basil,
                    dill, or any of the other hundreds of plants that love to grow in 
                    our Hydro-Stacker systems!

                <p>Our growing systems keep you involved in the plant life cycle by you 
                    determining the watering schedule. Our system includes an electric
                    pump and timer (you will need to get your own reservoir, 
                    a 55-gallon drum works great) for worry-free growing. 
                    Just fill the reservoir up as needed (about once every two weeks), 
                    and let the sun do all the work. Virtually any plant that can
                    be grown in soil can be grown in a Hydro-Stacker unit 
                    (obviously large plants like trees won't fare well). 
                    Pick up a couple of manual units for the corners of 
                    your driveway, flowers will grow so large they will look 
                    like shrubs
